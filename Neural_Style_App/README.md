# Neural Style Transfer App

Created an app for Neural Style Transfer named [StylizeMe](https://stylizeme.streamlit.app/) by pretrained VGG-19 model using PyTorch and Streamlit. The name StylizeMe was suggested by OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

Also added a Python Notebook where Neural Style Transfer was performed on an image using GPU on Google Colab.
